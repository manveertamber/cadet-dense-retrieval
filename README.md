# CADET Embeddings

We present CADET, a framework for fine-tuning embedding models for retrieval on specific corpora using diverse synthetic queries and cross-encoder listwise distillation.

We will continue to refine this codebase. For questions or support, please reach out to [mtamber@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:mtamber@uwaterloo.ca).
